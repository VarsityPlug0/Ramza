# Ramza's Chillas - Deployment Summary

## Application Overview
This is a Django-based fast food restaurant website with comprehensive content management capabilities. The application allows administrators full control over all text and images on the site.

## Key Features
- Responsive design with consistent styling
- Admin-controlled content management for all text and images
- Menu management system
- Order processing capabilities
- Custom admin dashboard
- Currency display in South African Rand (R)

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL database connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key (auto-generated by Render)
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY`: Number of Gunicorn worker processes (set to 4)

### Database Configuration
The application is configured to use a PostgreSQL database as specified in the Render configuration. The database connection string is:
```
postgresql://capitalxdb_user:cErzFTrAr2uuJ180NybFaWBVnr2gMLdI@dpg-d30rrh7diees7389fulg-a/capitalxdb
```

### Static and Media Files
- Static files are served using WhiteNoise
- Media files (uploaded images) are stored locally in the `media` directory
- Static files are collected to the `staticfiles` directory during deployment

### Migration Process
The application uses a custom setup script ([manual_setup.py](file:///c%3A/Users/money/Bevan%20The%20IT%20GUY/absa/ramzas-chillas/manual_setup.py)) that:
1. Sets up Django environment
2. Runs database migrations
3. Creates a default superuser (admin/admin123) if one doesn't exist

### Start Process
Render uses a shell script ([start.sh](file:///c%3A/Users/money/Bevan%20The%20IT%20GUY/absa/ramzas-chillas/start.sh)) that:
1. Makes the script executable
2. Runs the manual setup script to apply migrations
3. Starts Gunicorn with the Django application

This ensures that migrations are applied before the web server starts.

## Admin Access
- Admin dashboard: `/dashboard/`
- Django admin: `/admin/`
- Default superuser credentials: admin / admin123

## Recent Fixes
1. Fixed database migration issues by ensuring setup scripts run before web server start
2. Improved error handling in setup scripts
3. Switched to using a shell script for startup to ensure proper execution on Render
4. Verified migration process works correctly both locally and on Render

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Render logs for migration errors
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
4. Check that the setup scripts are running correctly
