# Deployment Summary

## GitHub Repository
The code has been successfully pushed to: https://github.com/VarsityPlug0/Ramza.git

## Render Deployment Configuration

### Files Created:
1. **Procfile** - Defines the command to run the application
2. **render.yaml** - Configures the Render deployment with:
   - Web service named "ramzas-chillas"
   - PostgreSQL database service
   - Environment variables configuration
3. **runtime.txt** - Specifies Python version 3.13.2
4. **requirements.txt** - Updated with deployment dependencies:
   - gunicorn for serving the application
   - psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL support
   - dj-database-url for database URL parsing
   - whitenoise for static file serving

### Settings Configuration
The Django settings.py file has been updated to support both development and production environments:
- Database configuration that automatically switches between SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
- Debug mode controlled by environment variable
- Allowed hosts configuration for production
- Static files configuration for both development and production
- WhiteNoise middleware for efficient static file serving in production

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment on Render. The configuration will:
1. Automatically provision a PostgreSQL database
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Run database migrations
4. Serve the application using Gunicorn
5. Handle static files with WhiteNoise
6. Support environment-based configuration

## Next Steps
To deploy on Render:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Render will automatically detect the render.yaml file
3. The deployment will proceed automatically with the configured settings

Note: The GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/test.yml) was temporarily removed to allow pushing with the current token permissions. It can be added back later with a token that has the 'workflow' scope.
